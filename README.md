# Scarlet Blade Vendetta WINE Launcher for Linux
Launcher for logging in and booting Scarlet Blade Vendetta on WINE using Linux. The script logs in through HTTP (like the official launcher), automatically patches XignCode with sbxigncode (code found https://github.com/nazgulsenpai/sbxigncode) with a x3.xem built to be compatible with WINE.

Tested on WINE 4.0 on Mint 19 and works flawlessly.

Usage:
python3 sb.py [username] [password]

If no username or password is passed then you will be prompted.
